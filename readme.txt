Original idea by ShiftTGC
Nope. No links from me. I only want to be credited for
taking a small part in this and for starting the idea for
making this script. Rex has done most/all the work on "this"
script. Not me... I did write this and the "REASON OF
CREATION" though. That's about it though.

                    REASON OF CREATION                     
-----------------------------------------------------------

The reason this script has been made, is for two reasons.
One, to be a dick, sort of. Two, to show an exploit that
should maybe be fixed.

So, what is this script? This script is a Space Engneers
script that has the intention of cripeling ships & bases.
For now, we know of a way to cripple one base/ship manualy.
One idea is to extend that out to first detect friendly
signals, connect to them and cripple them as well.
And with friendly, do we mean "block owner"

Now, why is this script bad? Because the exploit is to
give another player, faction owner, etc. the programable
block with the code runing on repeat.

Disables their programable blocks, powers
most blocks that can be "opened", disable turrets,
opens doors and hangards, close them, detonates wareheads,
stop batteries from giving power, stop large generators,
stop small generators, stop solar energy from being
harvested and... Yeah, you probably get it.
